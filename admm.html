		<p>The problem of Total Variation Denoising is known to be an ill-posed problem, but is very valuable to industry. Therefore, a range of algorithms have been invented to solve the optimisation problem.</p>
		<p>On this website you will find results of the following processes:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>A section on median filtering, to illustrate the classic techniques used in Image Processing to remove noise.</li>
			<li>Two modern algorithms for solving the Total Variation Denoising problem; Split Bregman and ADMM (The Alternating Directions Method with Multipliers).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here you find some results for my implementation of the <b>ADMM algorithm</b>. Change the sliders to see how the constants <span class="greek_symbol">λ</span>, <span class="greek_symbol">μ</span><sub>1</sub>, and <span class="greek_symbol">μ</span><sub>2</sub> affect the results. See below for more details on this algorithm.<p>

		<p>With this algorithm, we are trying to solve the (anisotropic) Total Variation Denoising Problem.
			This is the optimisation problem given by
			$$\min_f ||f-g||^2_2 + ||f||_{TV}$$
			where we have that
			$$||\cdot||_{TV} = \sum_i \sum_j \sqrt{(\nabla_x u(i,j))^2 + (\nabla_y u(i,j))^2}$$</p>
		<p>Essentially, the first term \( ||f-g||^2_2 \) of the problem ensures that the denoised image has the same characteristics as the noisy image, and the second term \(||f||_{TV}\) forces the denoising.</p>
		<p>The issue with this problem, is that the Total Variation semi-norm is not differentiable, and so there is no closed form solution to the denoising problem.
			Therefore, there are lots of algorithms that try to form an approximate solution, and here’s one of them.</p>
		<p>This algorithm uses the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) Method to solve the optimisation problem.
			Since we do not have a closed form solution, optimising this Lagrangian becomes difficult, but the ADMM method alternates optimising the \( x\) and \( y\) co-ordinates respectively.
		  For more information on the denoising algorithm, see [2].</p>
		<p>Contradictory to the Split Bregman Method, \( \lambda \) here is the ‘blurring factor’, and so this will have the most effect on the level of denoising.
			The algorithm also considers the two parameters \( \mu_1 \) and \(\mu_2 \), which we set to be equal above, which control the stability of the solution.
			See for yourself how they affect the end results by changing the sliders above.</p>
