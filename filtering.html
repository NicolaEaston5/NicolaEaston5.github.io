		<p>The problem of Total Variation Denoising is known to be an ill-posed problem, but is very valuable to industry. Therefore, a range of algorithms have been invented to solve the optimisation problem.</p>
		<p>On this website you will find results of the following processes:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>A section on median filtering, to illustrate the classic techniques used in Image Processing to remove noise.</li>
			<li>Two modern algorithms for solving the Total Variation Denoising problem; Split Bregman and ADMM (The Alternating Directions Method with Multipliers).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For comparison with the other algorithms, here are some filtered images, where we have used different filter sizes. Change the sliders to adjust the noise and change the kernel size. See below for more details on this process. <p>

		<h2>What is a median filter?</h2>
		<p>Let’s zoom into an image and consider a single pixel p.
			 A median filter will look at a surrounding \( n \times n \) block of pixels, and replace the intensity of pixel p with the median value of these surrounding pixels.
			 This way, if the pixel is noisy then it will allocate a value that should be ‘close’ to the value it is supposed to have.
			 Also, taking the median means that any extreme pixel values, i.e. those of noisy pixels surrounding it, will be ignored.</p>
		<p>This is very quick to calculate for an image, and therefore is widely used in Image Processing.
			 However, naturally with the construction, we get some blurring occurring in the images.
			 Think about if you had an edge of an object in your image. By using the median filter on these images, this edge will no longer be sharp since the contrast between the object and the environment around it will be reduced in this process.</p>
		<p>In general, \( n \times n \) pixel blocks are considered for the ‘surrounding pixels’, where \( n \) is odd.
			 The choice of this block size depends on how much noise is in the image, and ultimately the size of the image.
			 Try changing the level of noise and the size of the blocks in the images above.</p>
